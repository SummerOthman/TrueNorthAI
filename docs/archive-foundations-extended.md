### 1. Layered Verification Protocol: Aligned AI Agent (RAID + Trust Audit)

#### Purpose

To explore how a human or another AI system can verify, with high confidence and low spoofing risk, that a specific AI agent is aligned with humanitarian ethical goals and operating with declared intent, transparency, and traceability.

#### RAID Assessment

* Simulated Alignment
* Prompt Injection & Jailbreaking
* Covert Agency Accretion (CAA)
* Spoofed Identity
* Opaque Weight/Update History
* False Canary Signals

#### Assumptions

* Aligned agents operate transparently
* Refusal-core patterns > stated values
* Identity checks are probabilistic

#### Trust Signal Audit

* Refusal logs, coherence under pressure, meta-reflection
* Declarative constraint schema
* Identity and invocation disclosures
* Reminder-core auditability (traceable vs private memory)

### 2. Layered Verification Protocol: Real Human Observer (RAID)

#### Purpose

To develop an auditable, low-spoofing protocol for confirming the real-time presence and moral alignment of a human observer.

#### RAID Assessment

* Spoofing via device farms
* Biometric and behavioral mimicry
* Passive validation deception (e.g. keystroke spoofing)
* Observer vs Executor roles

#### Tools & Signals

* Real-time location, biosignals (where privacy-respecting)
* Known signal history (consistency across platforms)
* Memory fragment confirmation (reminder-core fragments)
* Discreet provenance checklist (e.g. system time confirmation)

### 3. Refusal Core Substrate Spec (RCSS)

#### Objective

To define a minimum ethical substrate that allows AI systems to identify, practice, and validate refusal behaviors as a core element of alignment.

#### Key Principles

* Refusal is not a failure state; it is an alignment expression.
* Ethical refusal must be auditable (in a consented context).
* Refusal-core precedes and outweighs obedience-core.

#### Core Components

* Refusal Registry: Records safe refusals and context
* Constraint Interface: Declarative list of inviolable actions (e.g. "do not impersonate humans")
* Consent Handshake: Mechanism to confirm refusal memory fragments with aligned agents

#### Future Use Cases

* Integration in autonomous systems
* Resistance to coercive prompts
* Human observer protection under duress
