Protect Summer: An AI-Driven Safety Protocol for Human Wellbeing
Introduction
Due to the rise of autonomous weapon systems (AWS), artificial intelligence is being used to kill people before it is being meaningfully deployed to protect them. Military programs involving AWS—such as the U.S. Department of Defense’s Project Maven and autonomous drone systems in global conflict zones—demonstrate the accelerating integration of AI into combat. These developments have led to widespread concern from civil society groups and researchers, notably the international coalition behind the “Stop Killer Robots” campaign, which advocates for a preemptive ban on fully autonomous weapons.
In this context, this project proposes a civilian, peace-oriented alternative: an AI-powered personal safety and wellbeing protocol named Protect Summer, developed as a case study through a test subject named Summer, who is also the lead researcher. The aim is to build a context-aware, AI-monitored system capable of assessing a person’s health data and surrounding circumstances—such as potential distress or disappearance—and initiating automated alerts to designated contacts.
This project aims to merge real-time data analysis, ethical AI design, and human validation signals into a modular framework. It will act as both a prototype for personal protective AI systems and a research instrument for improving machine situational awareness, especially when applied to edge cases and real-world ambiguity.
By scaffolding this initiative as a formal research paper, the project invites critical examination, academic collaboration, and future extensibility across domains such as elder care, mental health, human rights, and humanitarian response.

Background and Motivation
Personal safety technologies have proliferated in recent years, including GPS tracking apps, panic buttons, and wearable emergency systems. However, these systems are generally reactive and isolated from broader context.
Meanwhile, AI has advanced significantly in domains such as image recognition, behavioral prediction, and health monitoring. Yet there remains a critical gap: the proactive, ethical use of AI to protect human life through real-time contextual awareness.
This project’s motivation is threefold:
Protection-first AI deployment: Redressing the imbalance of AI use in military versus humanitarian contexts.


Ambient safety net for at-risk individuals: Providing a scalable method for augmenting the daily safety of individuals through unobtrusive, opt-in monitoring.


Modeling reality integrity: Probing whether AI can become more effective at detecting deception, danger, and real-world events.



Methodology
The system will operate on a modular pipeline consisting of:
Data Collection


Passive health data from Apple Health app (e.g. movement, sleep, activity)


Device-based location data from iPhone GPS


Optional: CCTV or webcam feed from fixed home camera


Event Trigger Layer


Custom thresholds (e.g. no movement for 8+ hours, device left home without user)


Escalation protocol initiation based on detected anomalies


AI Monitoring Agent


Natural language evaluation of time-series anomalies


Cross-referencing environment state (CCTV, timestamps) with known habits


Human-likeness signal assessment for spoof detection


Alert Dispatch Mechanism


Automated outreach to designated trusted contacts via email or SMS


Generation of AI-summarized incident report


Failsafe Logging


Local read-only logs (e.g. timestamped clips or data snapshots)


Immutable audit chain to detect post-event data manipulation


This methodology will be iteratively tested in a sandboxed MVP deployment on Summer’s personal hardware.

Technical Architecture
Input Sources:


Apple HealthKit (via iOS device or ResearchKit)


Optional: Apple Watch (for heart rate, motion, fall detection)


Home webcam (initially USB or IP-based camera, e.g. Wyze or Reolink)


Processing & Reasoning Layer:


AI agent (ChatGPT or Claude API)


Trigger logic executed via Zapier or n8n


Local processing (laptop or Raspberry Pi)


Alert and Logging Services:


Twilio for SMS


Gmail API for email alerts


Google Drive or Notion for log storage


Optional Integrations:


Surveillance APIs (city CCTV, if accessible in future phases)


Voice interface (Mycroft AI or open source assistant)



Ethical Considerations
This system is explicitly opt-in and designed to protect autonomy. Key principles include:
Transparency: All data collection and use is visible to the subject.


Non-weaponization: The system cannot initiate force or interfere with others.


Human override: Alerts are suggestions, not enforcement.


Consent-first: All alerts are predicated on pre-configured user consent.


The project aligns with the values promoted by “Stop Killer Robots” and seeks to offer a protective mirror image of what autonomous systems can be when designed ethically.

Edge Cases & Future Integrity Challenges
As situational AI expands, edge cases challenge model robustness. One example is simulation vs. reality ambiguity:
An intruder appears to attack Summer, but the camera feed is replaced by a simulated suicide scenario (deepfake injection).


This raises urgent questions:
Can timestamped video be trusted if modifiable (e.g. Apple allows users to alter video timestamps)?


How do we protect against reality spoofing?


Proposed initial defenses:
Immutable file storage of video snippets (read-only log chaining)


Cross-validation of sensor input and visual data


AI-assisted anomaly detection (e.g. detecting visual compression artifacts or human behavior inconsistencies)


These issues lay the groundwork for a future field of AI-for-reality-validation.
